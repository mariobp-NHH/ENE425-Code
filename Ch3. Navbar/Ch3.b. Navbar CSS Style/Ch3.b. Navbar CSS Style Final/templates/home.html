    <h1>Transport Carbon Emissions Calculator App</h1>
    <strong>Carbon emissions</strong> constitute the 60% of the ecological footprint, and are one of the
    main contributors to climate change.
    </br>
    </br>
    <strong>Transport carbon emissions</strong> are an important share of carbon emissions. During the course ENE425 Sustainable Energy
    and App Development at the Norwegian School of Economics, we design a <strong>methodology</strong> to
    compute transport carbon emissions, and we develop an <strong>App</strong> to track those emissions.
    </br>
    </br>
    In this web page, I describe that methodology, I deploy an app calculator where any person can work out transport her carbon emissions.
    I provide a link to the code of the App in my Github account. I also provide the methodoly to work out those emissions.
    Finally, I introduce a <strong>short bio</strong> and a link to my <strong>curriculum</strong>.

        <h5>Mario Bl√°zquez de Paz</h5>
        <p>Mario works in energy economics with an
            special focus on the design of electricity markets by using theoretical
            models and simulations. He teaches the course Sustainable Energy at NHH,
            where he connects green economy, digitalization, and app development.
            In his research and teaching, he uses different programming languages to create apps to conduct
            economic analysis in the fields of energy economics and sustainability.
